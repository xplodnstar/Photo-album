## Your Mission
We're going to create a photo gallery application which allows users to view their albums as well as the individual photos contained within. We'll implement this as a single page application (SPA). Use the following wireframes as layout inspiration:

![Albums View](./wireframeImgs/AlbumMain.png)
![Album View](./wireframeImgs/AlbumPics.png)
![Individual Image View](./wireframeImgs/AlbumIndiPage.png)

### Normal Mode

**Challenge #1.1:** Use your HTML & CSS knowledge to create the initial layouts for the SPA. Make sure you follow along with the wireframes above.

**Challenge #1.2:** Create a db.json file and use json-server to house all of your image and album data.

**Challenge #1.3:** Now that you've built the site layout, let's use React to make it dynamic. Make sure you can switch between your List, Album & Photo views without reloading the page. Clicking an Album should load a list of the photos, and clicking the photos should open them individually full-screen for viewing. Make sure you have a minimum of 6 photo albums with at least 3 photos each.

### Hard Mode

**Challenge #2.1:** In addition to Normal Mode challenges, update your individual photo view to allow a user to navigate to other photos in the same album by clicking to the left/right of the photo currently being viewed.

**Challenge #2.2:** Add the ability to add new photos to albums. You don't need to save the photos anywhere, but they should be added to the DOM and visible until the page is reloaded. Instead of trying to upload files, just add URL's to remote images. You should be able to add these photos via a simple form. Don't forget to update your Github respository.

### Epic Mode

**Challenge #3.1** Add the ability for a use to uplaod an image. You are allowed to use a service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) if you so choose.
